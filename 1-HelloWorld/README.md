# Hello World Project

Java programs have keywords. Each has a specific meaning and sometimes they need to be used in specific orders.

> **Note**
> 
> Keywords are case sensitive - public and Public and even PUBLIC are **different** things. (In fact in many another programing languages)

___
## Public 
The **public** Java keyword is an access modifier. An access modifier allow us to define the scope or how other parts of your code or even some else's code can access this code. More on that later.

## Class
The **class** keyword is used to define a class with the name following the keyword.

## Main Method
It's a collection of statements (1 or more) that performs an operation.
We'll be using a special method called the main method that Java looks for when running a program. It's the entry point of any Java code.

## Static
The **static** is a Java keyword that needs an understanding of other concepts, for now, know that we need to have static for Java to find our method to run the code we are going to add.

## Void
The **void** is another Java keyword used to indicate that the method will not return anything.

## Code Block
A **code block** is used to define a block of code. It's mandatory to have one in a method declaration and it's here where we will be adding statements to perform certain tasks.

## Statement
This is a complete command to be executed and can include one or more expressions
