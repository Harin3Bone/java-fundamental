# Control Flow Project
Something you really need and essential for programming, Is to be able to flow and decide where the flow of program is going to go and what code is going to be execute.

### Switch Case
A `Switch Case` statement it is like a `If-Else` but in a shortcut version

In `If-Else` you may be write code with this
```java
    int value = 3;

    if (value == 1) {
        System.out.println("Value was 1");
    } else if (value == 2) {
        System.out.println("Value was 2");
    } else {
        System.out.println("Value not was 1 or 2");
    }
```

But you can transform them into `Switch Case` like this
```java
    int switchValue = 1;

    switch (switchValue) {
        case 1:
            System.out.println("Value was 1");
            break;
        case 2:
            System.out.println("Value was 2");
            break;
        default:
            System.out.println("Value not was 1 or 2");
            break;
    }
```
